                    <p>Two devlogs in one week?! That's pretty exceptional, huh?</p>
                    <p>Well, it's been a <em>different</em> week - not bad, but one where I've been busy with other projects of mine. WriterSharp's been quiet, but I'm still finding time to update it whenever possible.</p>
                    
                    <hr />

                    <h2>AI Integration - Should WriterSharp join the party?</h2>
                    <p>From the very start, I've been trying to make WriterSharp <strong>non-opinionated</strong>, meaning it does not boss you around or force a workflow <em>(the only exception to this rule is the plugin API, which does, understandably, enforce some rules)</em>. It lets you do what you want, when you want.</p>
                    <p>Lately, AI-first code editors with built-in AI agents are all the rage. Which begs the question: <strong>should WriterSharp join the hype and have a bundled <em>native</em> AI agent?</strong></p>
                    <p>My answer? Nah. WriterSharp's strength is staying out of the way - not following trends just because someone on X says they're good. So it <strong>won't</strong> come with built-in AI of any sorts. If, however, you <em>really really</em> want AI support in WriterSharp, you could always create a plugin to add said feature.</p>
                    
                    <h2>"Supporting open-source is good." - Nuff said.</h2>
                    <p>WriterSharp isn't a big team project - hell, it's not even a small team project - it's me, solo, grinding some coding sessions. If you want to support my work and keep WriterSharp alive, I'd really appreciate it - you can support me at <strong><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/mf366">Buy Me A Coffee</a></strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Discord Community</h2>
                    <p>Ah, Discord... Right now, WriterSharp does not have its own Discord server and honestly, it'll <em>probably</em> never have one. Instead, when <a href="https://oceanapocalypsestudios.github.io/">OceanApocalypseStudios</a>'s Discord Server goes public, there'll be a dedicated spot to chat about my projects, WriterSharp included. Nothing fancy, just a chill place to hang out and share ideas.</p>
                    
                    <h2>WriterClassic</h2>
                    <p>Meet <strong><a href="https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic">WriterClassic</a></strong>: WriterSharp's predecessor. It wasn't built with C#, but rather with good ol' <a href="https://python.org/">Python</a> and <code>tkinter</code>.</p>
                    <p>WriterClassic had its fair share of quirks - some features were quite unique for a text editor. Its focus was mostly <strong>text editing</strong>, not code. And its plugin API? Let's just say it had its... rough edges.</p>
                    <p>That being said, WriterClassic holds a special place in my heart and I've learned a ton from its flaws. Those lessons are the backbone of WriterSharp's design, helping make it truly <em>sharp</em>.</p>
                    
                    <hr />

                    <p>That's it for now! Thank you so much for stopping by and taking your time to read this devlog. If you liked it, consider sharing it around - it would help immensely with letting WriterSharp reach more people.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile, see you on GitHub... or in the next devlog!</p>
