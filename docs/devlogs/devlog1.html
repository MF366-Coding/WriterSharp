                    <p>Welcome to the very first WriterSharp devlog - now hosted in WriterSharp's brand new site.</p>
                    <p>Yep, that's right, everyone! I've officially moved from the <em>tiny little section on my main site</em> to a dedicated site just for WriterSharp. While still a work in progress - very much like the program itself - it allows me to connect, share updates and be transparent with those who are interested - or just curious - in WriterSharp's development and eventual release.</p>

                    <h2>Plugin API Progress</h2>
                    <p>WriterSharp development this week has been quieter than usual, but progress is still happening behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, the <strong>plugin API</strong> has been a focus in development, as I'm focused on defining the structure and laying down the foundations. No actual implementation just yet, but having a clean, flexible and maintainable API design is crucial, in my opinion, given the fact it's one of WriterSharp's strengths and one of the aspects that sets it apart from other code editor whose APIs might feel more... confusing.</p>
                    
                    <h2>So what about the devlogs?</h2>
                    <p>Devlogs like these were an idea that occurred to me in order to keep you in the loop: sometimes, I'll share technical insights</p>
                    <p>The devlogs were an idea I had to keep people informed about WriterSharp's development. Sometimes I share technical stuff, other times I'll be more vision-focused: what's coming, what's changing, what I'm excited about, what's stressing me out, etc. That's the reason why there are tags at the top of the devlog - that way, you'll know if it interests you <em>(or not)</em>.</p>
                    <p>They're <em>usually</em> <strong>weekly</strong>, but in rare occasions I may write more than 1 devlog per week... or sometimes I may write none, but then again - that's in very rare occasions.</p>
                    <p>Most of the devlogs <em>(this one included)</em> are <strong>completely free</strong>. However, there will be some paid devlogs as well, as a way to support WriterSharp's development. It's a small but quite meaningful way to help fund a <strong>fully open-source</strong>, free code editor. In a future post, I'll share how to access them.</p>
                    
                    <hr />

                    <p>That's it for now! Thank you so much for stopping by and taking your time to read this devlog. If you liked it, consider sharing it around - it would help immensely with letting WriterSharp reach more people.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile, see you on GitHub... or in the next devlog!</p>
