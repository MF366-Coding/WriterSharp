Two devlogs in one week?! That's pretty exceptional, huh?

Well, it's been a _different_ week - not bad, but one where I've been busy with other projects of mine. WriterSharp's been quiet, but I'm still finding time to update it whenever possible.

## AI Integration - Should WriterSharp join the party?
From the very start, I've been trying to make WriterSharp **non-opinionated**, meaning it does not boss you around or force a workflow _(the only exception to this rule is the plugin API, which does, understandably, enforce some rules)_. It lets you do what you want, when you want.

Lately, AI-first code editors with built-in AI agents are all the rage. Which begs the question: **should WriterSharp join the hype and have a bundled _native_ AI agent?**

My answer? Nah. WriterSharp's strength is staying out of the way - not following trends just because someone on X says they're good. So it **won't** come with built-in AI of any sorts. If, however, you _really really_ want AI support in WriterSharp, you could always create a plugin to add said feature.

## "Supporting open-source is good." - Nuff said.
WriterSharp isn't a big team project - hell, it's not even a small team project - it's me, solo, grinding some coding sessions. If you want to support my work and keep WriterSharp alive, I'd really appreciate it - you can support me at **[Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mf366)**.

If you wish to go further, join my **membership tiers**! Monthly or yearly support unlocks premium devlogs, tech demos, behind-the-scenes peeks and much more.

## Discord Community
Ah, Discord... Right now, WriterSharp does not have its own Discord server and honestly, it'll _probably_ never have one. Instead, when [OceanApocalypseStudios](https://oceanapocalypsestudios.github.io/)'s Discord Server goes public, there'll be a dedicated spot to chat about my projects, WriterSharp included. Nothing fancy, just a chill place to hang out and share ideas.

## WriterClassic
Meet **[WriterClassic](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic)**: WriterSharp's predecessor. It wasn't built with C#, but rather with good ol' [Python](https://python.org/) and `tkinter`.

WriterClassic had its fair share of quirks - some features were quite unique for a text editor. Its focus was mostly **text editing**, not code. And its plugin API? Let's just say it had its... rough edges.

That being said, WriterClassic holds a special place in my heart and I've learned a ton from its flaws. Those lessons are the backbone of WriterSharp's design, helping make it truly _sharp_.

That's it for now! Thank you so much for stopping by and taking your time to read this devlog. If you liked it, consider sharing it around - it would help immensely with letting WriterSharp reach more people.

In the meanwhile, see you on GitHub... or in the next devlog!
