So, what is **WriterSharp**?

Well, long time ago *(it was only 3 years)*, I created a Python program with a GUI called [**WriterClassic**](https://github.com/MF366-Coding/WriterClassic). It was a basic text editor that evolved into something special - at least for me.

It was my biggest project for quite a while and it was also... my first actual programming project. I mean, public at least.

I ended up releasing 11 major versions for it and almost released v12.0.0, but I couldn't. The codebase was old and unorganized and it was getting increasingly hard to maintain WriterClassic.

So, **WriterSharp** was born. WriterSharp (please don't write **Writer#** - it's cursed) is WriterClassic but in C#, with a more modern look and better cross-platform compatibility.

I also made the decision of not dropping the WriterClassic logo for a new one, because **A) It was made by a friend** and **B) It's *classic* :)**.
